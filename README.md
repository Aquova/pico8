# A collection of my Pico-8 games

[Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is a "fantasy video game console", that is to say, a video game console that never existed. Despite never existing, you can make games for it, and here are a selection of what I think are my more noteworthy attempts!

## Game Selection
- Bongo Cat
    - A small animation demo made back when the Bongo Cat meme was all the rage
- Doodles
    - A collection of small doodles too minor to warrant their own folder
- Final Fantasy Prelude
    - A composition of the title theme from the *Final Fantasy* series
- Game of Life
    - Conway's Game of Life done in Pico-8, complete with editor
- Huck Dunt
    - A demake of Duck Hunt done to fit in the length of two tweets (480 characters)
- Icosahedron
    - An early attempt of mine to learn 3D graphic theory
    - Also includes an attempt to make the N64 logo in my terrible, terrible 3D engine.
- Piconian
    - My first game! A demake of the arcade game *Bosconian*
- Rally-8
    - An unfinished demake of the arcade game *Rally-X*. Playable, but not polished.
- Raycaster
    - A "3D" demo made in the style of *Wolfenstein 3D*.
- Simon Says
    - A Simon Says clone made for another Tweet Jam.
- Snowman
    - A snowman themed puzzle game made while avoiding relatives at Christmas.
- Starmoo Valley
    - A birthday gift to an online friend, full of weird in-jokes.
